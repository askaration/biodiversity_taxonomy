# biodiversity_taxonomy


1. Background and Introduction:
The proposed research on biodiversity taxonomies aligns seamlessly with my academic interests, extending from my metadata course project focused on standards. Through Dr. Cheng's courses, I gained insights into the complexities of organizing information, forming a solid foundation in metadata standards.
The biodiversity taxonomies project aims to explore challenges in biodiversity data management, allowing me to contribute meaningfully to the scientific discourse.

2. Goals and Objectives:
My primary goals in this project are to deepen my understanding of biodiversity taxonomies, enhance data cleaning and management skills using tools like OpenRefine and Python, and contribute to testing and comparing relevant toolkits. This aligns with my concentration in Data Science, offering a practical application to real-world challenges in biodiversity research.


3. Method or Approach:
To execute the project, I plan a systematic approach: comprehensive literature review, hands-on data cleaning with OpenRefine and Python, and rigorous toolkit testing.

4. Deliverables:
Expected deliverables include a final report summarizing insights, challenges, and methodologies. Additionally, I aim to create a short paper or poster for conferences like iConference and ASIS&T, contributing to the academic community.
